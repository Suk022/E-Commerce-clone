# Amazon Clone - E-commerce Webpage

This is a **work-in-progress front-end clone** of an Amazon-style e-commerce webpage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. So far, I've implemented the homepage, product listing, cart functionality, and basic checkout page structure.

## Current Status

✅ Completed:
- Homepage with product listings
- Add to cart functionality
- Cart page displaying selected items and total price
- Checkout page layout (HTML only)

❌ Yet to be implemented:
- Functional checkout logic
- User authentication
- Responsive design improvements
- Delivery estimation system and more functionalities
